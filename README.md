## Project Overview

This project segment focuses on the implementation and evaluation of Softmax Regression to perform sentiment analysis on tweets concerning COVID-19 vaccinations. The analysis categorizes tweets into three sentiment classes: 0 (neutral), 1 (negative), and 2 (positive).

## Softmax Regression Model

Softmax Regression has been employed as the initial model in our series of experiments. It is a generalization of logistic regression that we use for multi-class classification, making it suitable for our three-class sentiment analysis task. 

### Model Performance

The performance of the Softmax Regression model is as follows:

| Model               | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|---------------------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Softmax Regression  | 73.093%   | 73.4%   | 72.967%  | 73%      |

### Development and Evaluation

In the development phase, various hyperparameters were tuned to optimize model performance. The details of these experiments can be explored in the project's Jupyter notebooks, which document the different configurations tested and their impact on model accuracy.

## Purpose

This project was developed to focus solely on the Softmax Regression model, detailing its setup, performance, and educational purpose.
